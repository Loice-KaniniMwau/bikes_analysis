# The Bikes Shop - Sales Data Analysis

## Overview

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of the sales data for "The Bikes Shop." The primary goal was to clean a raw SQL database dump, standardize customer information, and derive key metrics to understand sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends. The entire process, from data cleaning to final analysis, was conducted using SQL within MySQL Workbench.


## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

* **Database:** MySQL Server
* **IDE:** MySQL Workbench
* **Language:** SQL


##  methodology

The analysis was performed in three main stages: data examination, data cleaning, and metric extraction.

### 1. Data Examination

The first step was to load the `thebikes_shop.sql` database dump and perform an initial exploration of the tables to understand the schema and identify data quality issues. Key tables examined included `tbl_customers`, `tbl_orders`, `tbl_products`, `tbl_brands`, and `tbl_payments`.

Initial findings revealed inconsistencies in customer contact information, such as varied phone number formats and empty strings in the email column.

### 2. Data Cleaning

Significant effort was placed on cleaning and standardizing the customer data in `tbl_customers` to ensure accuracy for analysis and future outreach.

Standardizing Phone Numbers:** Phone numbers were updated to a consistent international format (`+254...`).
  
Cleaning Emails:** Empty email fields, which were stored as empty strings `''`, were updated to `NULL` for better data integrity.


### 3. Data Analysis

With a cleaner dataset, a series of SQL queries were executed to answer key business questions and generate performance metrics.
